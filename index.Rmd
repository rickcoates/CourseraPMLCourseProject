### Synopsis

Physical exercise (weight-lifting) data from the Human Activity Recognition 
Project was used to develop a predictive model capable of producing accurate
predictions of the quality of exercise performance, based on the data from 
sensors worn by human subjects performing the exercise. 

* Exploratory data analysis was performed to eliminate potential confounders 
and near-zero variance sensor variables. 
* Both random forest and gradient boost prediction models were developed and 
their performance was determined/compared using cross validation. 
* A random forest model using all useful sensor variables as predictors 
achieved a greater than 99% overall prediction accuracy against a (30%) hold
out data set.
* An ad-hoc ensembling technique was used to verify that both the random
forest and gradient boost models produced the same predictions when run
against a 20 sample set of data for which the target class was not known.

### Data Processing

#### Download and Read the Data

The data used in this analysis is drawn from the Weight Lifting Exercises 
Dataset from the [Human Activity Recognition Project](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). 
For the purposes of this exercise, the data have been split into a *training* data 
set that includes approximately 20,000 observations of 159 potential predictor 
variables, plus a *classe* variable that denotes the five different manners in 
which a specific weight-lifting exercise can be performed ([1][1]), and a 
testing data set that includes 20 samples for which the *classe* variable is 
to be determined by a predictive model, using some or all of the 159 
potential predictor variables. 

```{r load_and_read_data, cache=TRUE}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", "pml-training.csv", method="curl")
dateTrainingDownloaded <- date()
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", "pml-testing.csv", method="curl")
dateTestDownloaded <- date()
raw.data <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA",""), stringsAsFactors=TRUE);
raw.test <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings = c("NA",""), stringsAsFactors=TRUE);
dim(raw.data); dim(raw.test);
```

The training data was downloaded on **`r dateTrainingDownloaded`** and the 
test data was downloaded on **`r dateTestDownloaded`**.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning the Data

A review of the training data shows seven (7) non-sensor variables (e.g. 
*user_name*, various timestamps), 152 sensor variables and the "target" 
variable, *classe*.

Using purely sensor variables, for predicting the manner in which a specific 
weight-lifting exercise was performed, is intuitively satisfying, since it 
eliminates any confounding influence that the non-sensor variables might 
introduce. 

In addition, a large number of the sensor variables contain little or no
data (i.e. they have a very high proportion of NA's). Since, correspondingly, 
these sensor variables possess little predictive power, they are eliminated
from the training set.

The following R code: 

1. Removes the non-sensor variables (likely confounders)
2. Remove sensor variables with very little data (>95% NA)

```{r preprocess}
data <- raw.data[, -c(1:7)]
na.density <- apply(data, 2, function(x) mean(is.na(x)))
high.na.variables <- names(na.density[na.density > 0.95])
qar <- data[ , -which(names(data) %in% high.na.variables)]
````

### Cross Validation

In order to perform cross-validation within the training data set provided, and
to validate/confirm the out-of-sample error for the predictive model, the training
data is split into a model training data set and a model testing (hold out) data 
set. The *caret* package is used to partition the data into 70% training and 30% 
testing.

```{r crossvalidation}
set.seed(8484)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=qar$classe, p=0.70, list=FALSE)
training <- qar[inTrain, ]
testing <- qar[-inTrain, ]
dim(training); dim(testing)
````

### Building the Predictive Model

Based on the success of boosting, random forests and model ensembling in 
winning Kaggle and other prediction contests ([2][2]), a random forest
and a gradient boost model were built/trained and their accuracy against
the hold out (testing) data set was evaluated to assess their performance.

#### Random Forest

The initial random forest model is built using all of the "useful" sensor 
variables, as determined by exploratory data analysis (see above). Note that 
**additional bootstrap cross validation** is inherent in random forest models: 
"About one-third of the cases are left out of the bootstrap sample and not 
used in the construction of the kth tree." ([3][3])

```{r rf_build, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(33833) ## for reproducability
rf.fit <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=training, importance=TRUE)
```

```{r rf_fit_plot, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
plot(rf.fit, main="Figure 1 - In Sample Error Rate as Forest Grows (All Variables)")
```
```{r rf_varimplot, fig.width=9, fig.height=7, echo=FALSE}
varImpPlot(rf.fit, main="Figure 2 - Variable Importance as Determined by Random Forest")
```

Some comment about only using the most important (e.g. top 18) variables
and the effect on the model accuracy.

```{r rf_imp, cache=TRUE}
imp <- data.frame(importance(rf.fit))
no.of.variables <- 18
top.variables <- rownames(imp[with(imp, order(-MeanDecreaseGini)), ])[1:no.of.variables]
train2 <- training[ , which(names(training) %in% c(top.variables, "classe"))]
set.seed(33833)
rf.imp.fit <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=train2)
```

```{r rf_imp_fit_plot, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
plot(rf.fit, main="In Sample Error Rate as Forest Grows (Most Important Variables)")
```
```

```{r rf_eval}
rf.ise <- confusionMatrix(training$classe, predict(rf.fit, training[,-53]))
rf.imp.ise <- confusionMatrix(train2$classe, predict(rf.imp.fit, train2[,-19]))
rf.ise$overall[1]; rf.imp.ise$overall[1]
````

#### Gradient Boosting

Try a boosting model to see if we get the same answers.

```{r gbm_build, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(88388)
gbm.fit <- train(classe ~ ., method="gbm", data=training, verbose=FALSE)
```

```{r gbm_plot, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
plot(gbm.fit, main="Accuracy vs Max Tree Depth as Boosting Iterations Increase")
```
```{r gbm_eval}
gbm.ise <- confusionMatrix(training$classe, predict(gbm.fit, training[,-53]))
gbm.ise$table; gbm.ise$overall[1]
````

The Gradient Boost model has a lower in-sample accuracy than the Random Forest model
(`r round(gbm.ise$overall[1]*100,2) `% vs `r round(rf.ise$overall[1]*100,2) `%)

#### Determining Model Performance (Out-of-Sample Error)

The out-of-sample error performance of each model is determined by computing a
confusion matrix that compares the model prediction with the "known truth" from 
the model testing (hold out) data set.

Determining the out-of-sample performance for the random forest model with all 
variables:
```{r rf_oos_error}
rf.ose <- confusionMatrix(testing$classe, predict(rf.fit, testing[,-53]))
rf.ose$table; rf.ose$overall[1]
````

Determining the out-of-sample performance for the random forest model with the 
most important variables:
```{r rf_imp_oos_error}
test2 <- testing[ , which(names(testing) %in% c(top.variables, "classe"))]
rf.imp.ose <- confusionMatrix(test2$classe, predict(rf.imp.fit, test2[,-19]))
rf.imp.ose$table; rf.imp.ose$overall[1]
````

Determining the out-of-sample performance for the gradient boost model with all 
variables:
```{r gbm_oos_error}
gbm.ose <- confusionMatrix(testing$classe, predict(gbm.fit, testing[,-53]))
gbm.ose$table; gbm.ose$overall[1]
```

The random forest model that uses all of the useful sensor variables has the
lowest out-of-sample error rate (`r round((1-rf.ose$overall[1])*100,2) `%),
followed by the random forest model that uses the most important sensor 
variables (`r round((1-rf.imp.ose$overall[1])*100,2) `%), followed by the
gradient boost model (`r round((1-gbm.ose$overall[1])*100,2) `%).

**As a result of this analysis, the random forest model that uses all of the 
useful sensor variables is selected as the model of choice.**

#### Predicting the Testing Set Classifications

The (all variable) random forest model and the gradient boost model are used
to predict the *classe* variable for the original testing data set with the 20 
samples for which the *classe* is unknown (and is to be predicted as part of
this exercise). Finally, the predictions from the two different models are 
compared in an ad-hoc ensembling technique

Pre-processing of the test data to remove non-sensor variables and sensor
variables with >95% NA's:
```{r build_test_data}
test.data <- raw.test[, -c(1:7)]
test.qar <- test.data[ , -which(names(test.data) %in% high.na.variables)]
```

Predict the *classe* for the 20 samples using the random forest model:
```{r rf_answers}
answers.rf <- as.character(predict(rf.fit, test.qar[-53])); answers.rf
````

Predict the *classe* for the 20 samples using the gradient boost model:
```{r gbm_answers}
answers.gbm <- as.character(predict(gbm.fit, test.qar[-53])); answers.gbm
```

Compare the predictions of the two different models:
```{r answer_agreement}
setdiff(answers.rf, answers.gbm); setequal(answers.rf, answers.gbm)
```

```{r create_answer_files, echo=FALSE}
## write out the answer files for submission to the Coursera web site
pml_write_files = function(x){
    n = length(x)
    for(i in 1:n){
        filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
        write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
    }
}
pml_write_files(answers.rf)
```

#### Conclusion

The "ad-hoc" ensembling technique of comparing the predictions from the two
different types of models indicates that both the random forest and gradient
boost models yield identical results, which increases the confidence that the
model of choice (random forest with all useful sensor variables) produces
accurate predictions.
